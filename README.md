 **code fun do project idea**
 
 Here is the projct idea of our team (code_geeks) for code fun do++ 2018.
 
 **Project Theme**
 
 Effective Rescue of people and management of limited resources during a flood.
 
 **********************************************************************
 
Brief Summary of what we will be implementing in this project :)

********************************************************************************************************************************* 
As country like india is very proned to natural disasters like floods which kind of appear every year, so it becomes very 

important to tackle such calamity and resuce people with all the possible help and manage the limited resources effectively. 

Following the same idea our team will be building a web app which has a number of functionalities to help the victims and guide 

the voulunteers and government to make some quick and targeted actions. Here are some of the features we will be working on :)

* Accepting donations which will include - monetary help, clothing , blood donations , sanitary and other objects. 

* A console to register lost and found people during the disaster.

* One of the biggest issue during the rescue operation is that the number of volunteer distrbution is uneven , i.e during a 

particular day and time number of volunteer is maximum and the next moment we are out of them. To resolve this issue we will be 

registering volunteers and also there availibility date and time and finally using the data we can guide them to have a maximum 

output.

* Another big issue faced by the rescuers is that they din't know the frequecy of victims in a particualr area which kind of 

resist them to give their full service and to resolve this we will use a feature where people can register themselves, their 

location and also the approx number of people stuck in that area which could be used by government to take some strict 

actions.

* our web app will act as a common platform for all the relief camps and NGOs and using the available data they could also 

maximize their output.

* At last the web app will contain all the important links ,blogs and contact numbers which could be needed during the disaster
 
 if time permits we will definiely add features like:)
 
 * Taking the weather information and updating the areas which are more proned to the flood so that some strict action could be 
 
 taken in advance.
